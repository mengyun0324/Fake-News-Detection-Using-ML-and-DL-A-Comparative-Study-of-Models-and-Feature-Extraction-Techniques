# Fake-News-Detection-Using-ML-and-DL-A-Comparative-Study-of-Models-and-Feature-Extraction-Techniques
A comparative study of machine learning and deep learning models for fake news detection using headline-only text. Includes full NLP preprocessing, feature engineering, classical ML models, and a CNN implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.

This project was developed as the final exam project for the Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics course. It builds a fake news detection system using headline-only text and compares traditional machine learning models with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

Key Features  

- NLP preprocessing: text cleaning, tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF
- Trained multiple ML models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest
- Developed a custom TensorFlow/Keras CNN, achieving over 94% accuracy and precision
- Analysis of performance differences between classical ML methods and the CNN model
